## R code output

The beauty of R Markdown: including your data analysis directly in the thesis, so that you update as you go.

```{r}
variable_t = 3 * 4
```

Variable_t has a value of: `r variable_t`. Note the use of backticks instead of quotations marks. Backticks can also be used to write code-like text: `here is some code` or even do a quick calculation (3 * 6 = : `r 3*6` ).

And of course, let's make a plot. You can refer to it in text as normal: see figure \ref{irisgraph}.

```{r fig.cap = "Figure caption. \\label{irisgraph}", fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(iris)
```


## Tables

This is a \LaTeX  table in an R Markdown document:

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{This is a table with info}
\label{table-paramvalues}
\begin{tabular}{ p{4cm} p{4cm} p{4cm} }
\hline \\ [-1.5ex]
colname & colname & colname \\ [1ex]
\hline \\ [-1.5ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
Info & info & info \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Personally, I prefer \LaTeX tables over R Markdown tables, because you can tweak them a bit more.

## Figures

And of course, we can also inlude figures (see figure \ref{figurelabel}).
