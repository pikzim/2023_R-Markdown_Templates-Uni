# Methods

In \autoref{label1} we had look at citations and headings. What about some equations? Let's put one here: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-abc}
a + b = c
\end{equation}

You can also write it inline: $a + b = c$ or use the $-signs to refer to a symbol, for example: $a$ is distance (m).

To refer to the equation in text, you can write: see equation \ref{eq-abc}. If you use the autoref command, it will automatically specify what kind of LaTeX object you are referring to, for example: see \autoref{eq-abc}.
